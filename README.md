# Telegram Movie Bot

Note: AI assistance was used only for creating and refining this README file. My outcome is to learn how to read documentation and write code from start to finish without relying on AI-generated code, thereby reinforcing my ability to create code and solve problems myself.
## Description

This is a learning project aimed at creating a Telegram bot that automatically notifies users about new movies available from a specified RSS feed. The bot also provides a button to download the movie directly to a Raspberry Pi using qBittorrent. 

## My Challenges

I will be listing all the new things and challenges I encounter throughout the project.

## Features

- **RSS Feed Monitoring:** Regularly checks a given RSS feed for new movies.
- **Telegram Notifications:** Sends a message to the Telegram chat whenever a new movie is detected.
- **Direct Download:** Provides a button to download the movie to a Raspberry Pi using qBittorrent.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple commands and interactive buttons for an improved user experience.
